# gold-price-prediction-using-ML
I used Random Forest Regression Model to predict the gold price.
In Random Forest Regression I take 100 Decision trees majority value as a output.
We caluclate the error rate by using actual test data and predicted test data by (r2 score)ScikitLearn library.
The error rate is very less which means Accuracy is high.
